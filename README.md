Spam Classification Using Machine Learning
This project implements Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier to classify emails as spam or not.

Dataset
The dataset contains various word and character frequency features, along with a binary label (spam) indicating whether an email is spam (1) or not (0).

Steps
Load the dataset.
Preprocess data (split into train/test, standardize features).
Train two models:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Evaluate accuracy:
Logistic Regression: 92.94%
Random Forest: 94.46%
Results
The Random Forest Classifier outperformed Logistic Regression with a higher accuracy.
